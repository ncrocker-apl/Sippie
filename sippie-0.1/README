You can find documentation about the usage and a quick start guide for
programming in the doc folder of the sourceforge project. All necessary 
configuration files are contained in the compressed folder of the executable,
which you can download from the project homepage. 

NOTICE: Currently the application only works for 32-bit systems (maybe a 32 bit
java version works too), because of the requirement of some native library. If
possible this requirement will be removed in the future.

If you would like contributing to this project or you have some questions
concerning the usage feel free to drop me an email:
